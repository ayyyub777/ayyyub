---

Hey, I'm Ayoub Bigharassine, a 23-year-old software developer from Agadir, Morocco. My journey began during college while studying chemistry. In the second semester of 2019, coding captured my attention and swiftly evolved into my true passion. Chemistry took a backseat, and that's when I fully immersed myself in the dynamic world of coding.

I went to Casablanca and joined a five-month boot-camp to dive deeper into web development after getting the hang of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics. a chapter of financial reality unfolded. I pressed the pause button, not on my dreams but on my coding journey, to navigate the twists of life.

Resuming my coding journey in 2021, I delved headfirst into more advanced concepts and broadened my expertise in full-stack development. Alongside my studies, I took on freelance gigs, applying my skills to real-world projects.

Now, I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute my passion and skills as I continue my learning journey. I am open to collaborations, internships, or any opportunity that allows me to grow as a developer.

As I step into the next phase of my tech journey, I'm committed to finding new challenges that elevate my coding skills.

Let's connect and explore limitless possibilities together!
