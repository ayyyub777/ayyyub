Hi, I'm Ayoub Bigharassine, a 24-year-old software developer from Morocco.

⚡️ I build production-ready MVPs for B2B, B2C, marketplaces, e-commerce, appointment systems, SaaS, and complex enterprise solutions.

1️⃣ I design user-centered experiences through user research and usability testing.

2️⃣ I develop solutions with clean, maintainable code, applying proven design patterns and best practices.

3️⃣ I deploy scalable applications and services using cloud technologies.

4️⃣ I optimize application performance through strategic code refactoring, caching, and SEO best practices.

5️⃣ I integrate third-party APIs to enrich application functionality and reduce time to market.

💬 Currently open to new opportunities that offer technical growth, meaningful challenges, and the chance to contribute to high-impact products.
