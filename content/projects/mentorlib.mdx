## Database Schema

The Mentorlib schema is designed to facilitate a marketplace platform connecting clients with experts. Key components include:
![Database schema](http://localhost:3000/projects/mentorlib/mentorlib-schema.svg)

- **User**: The core model that differentiates clients and experts via the `UserRole` enum. It includes fields such as `email`, `password`, and `image`, ensuring secure authentication and user personalization.

- **ExpertProfile**: This model captures expert details including `name`, `url`, `bio`, and `status`. The status field utilizes a `Status` enum to manage profile visibility, while the model establishes relationships with `Service` offerings and `UserWorkingHours`.

- **Service**: Represents various services offered by experts, detailing `serviceType`, `title`, `price`, and `duration`. This model links to `ExpertProfile`, enabling dynamic service management based on expert availability.

- **Scheduling**: Facilitates appointment bookings by capturing details such as `date`, `email`, and `note`. It creates relationships with both `User` and `ExpertProfile`, ensuring an organized scheduling process.

- **UserWorkingHours**: Defines expert availability, specifying working hours for each day of the week. This model enhances scheduling by providing real-time availability to clients.

## Challenges Faced

### Challenge

**Availability Times Data Storage**: Storing availability times in a way that accommodates various time zones can be complex. To ensure consistency and ease of comparison, it is crucial to convert all time inputs into a universal format. The solution involves converting local times into seconds since a defined start time (12:00 AM) to store in the database.

### Solution

Convert the user-provided availability times into seconds since 12:00 AM (midnight) using UTC, allowing for consistent storage and easy calculations. This approach simplifies comparisons and adjustments based on different time zones.

### Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a relevant code snippet demonstrating how to convert time into seconds since midnight for storage:

```typescript
import moment from "moment-timezone";

/**
 * Convert time in minutes since midnight to UTC
 * @param {number} minutes - Time in minutes since midnight
 * @param {string} timezone - User's timezone
 * @returns {number} - Time in minutes since midnight UTC
 */
const convertToUTC = (minutes, timezone) => {
  const time = convertMinutesToTime(minutes);
  const localTime = moment.tz(`1970-01-01 ${time}`, timezone);
  const utcTime = localTime.utc();
  return utcTime.hours() * 60 + utcTime.minutes();
};

/**
 * Convert minutes since midnight to a formatted time string
 * @param {number} minutes - Time in minutes since midnight
 * @returns {string} - Formatted time string (HH:mm)
 */
const convertMinutesToTime = (minutes) => {
  const hours = Math.floor(minutes / 60);
  const mins = minutes % 60;
  return `${hours.toString().padStart(2, "0")}:${mins
    .toString()
    .padStart(2, "0")}`;
};

/**
 * Convert time string (HH:mm) to minutes since midnight
 * @param {string} time - Time string in HH:mm format
 * @returns {number} - Time in minutes since midnight
 */
const convertTimeToMinutes = (time) => {
  const [hoursStr, minutesStr] = time.split(":");
  const hours = Number(hoursStr);
  const minutes = Number(minutesStr);
  return hours * 60 + minutes;
};
```
